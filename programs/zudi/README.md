# Zambesii UDIProps Compiler and Parser:

Currently it comprises:
* A binary database compiler, which parses and compiles
  UDI udiprops driver configuration files into a machine readable
  format on behalf of the kernel.
* A simple shell script which gathers all udiprops files within a target
  folder, and adds them to the binary index.
