===============>if (h_dvd < (signed)(h_s + carry)) { <==========================
			h_s >>= 1;"

		Was receiving a warning about this comparison (signed and
		unsigned ints being compared). Did my best to choose the least
		harmful conversion, and chose to cast the right-hand operand to
		signed. May have been wrong, and this may be a bug.
