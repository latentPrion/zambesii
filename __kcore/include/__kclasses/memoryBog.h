/**	EXPLANATION:
 * A memoryBog is essentially the equivalent of what is known as a heap. The
 * Zambesii memory bog is a large block partitioning allocator for the kernel
 * which does *not* cache object sizes. All it does is take a specific block
 * size, and allocate blocks of memory of that size. It keeps a linked list
 * of all of the blocks it has allocated for that bog size so far.
 *
 * From there, things are very simple: To allocate, the memoryBog class
 * will traverse a list of nodes of variable sizes (this is very similar to
 * VSwamp, and was inspired by VSwamp.) until a node of suitable size has been
 * found. This node's size will be decremented, and a pointer to the found
 * memory will be returned.
 *
 * To free, the list is traversed until the freed memory's rightful position is
 * found. The memory is placed into its slot, and linked back into a larger
 * node if necessary, and
