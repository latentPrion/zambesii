/**	EXPLANATION:
 * The Debug Pipe Buffer takes all the raw code points from the DebugPipe
 * object and stores them, uninterpreted, into itself.
 *
 * The idea behind this buffer is such that the kernel debug output can be kept
 * safe for later dumping, so any printing done while, say, the kernel has
 * untied the debug pipe from all hardware will all go into the buffer.
 *
 * The buffer is statically sized, and its initial size is set with
 * DEBUGBUFFER_INIT_NPAGES below. This initial buffer is resized after the
 * NUMA Tributary's initialize2() routine, which allows the kernel to take
 * full advantage of the chipset's memory.
 *
 * At that point, the kernel will allocate more memory, and link it to the
 * end of the buffer, effectively extending the buffer to allow for more
 * output.
 *
 * That is to say, this class has been written to be implicitly dynamically
 * sized. However, the dynamicity was pulled since it created a circular
 * dependency. So now it's generationally dynamically sized, in that it is
 * resized in stages throughout the kernel's initialization.
