/*	NOTE:
 * This is more of a Walker Page Ranger option when mapping, used only for
 * certain special use cases in the kernel; You most likely don't need to use
 * this flag. It is defined here solely for ease of maintenance since all the
 * other values for the "flags" argument to Walker Page Ranger are in here too.
 * In theory it should be in walkerPageRanger.h and should be called
 * WPRANGER_FLAG_FLUSH_LOCALLY_ONLY since it is a WPR option, and not a page
 * attribute.
 *
 * This flag when passed, is interpreted by Walker Page Ranger directly, and
 * does not affect the way the relevant page is mapped. It only indicates to
 * WPR that it should not attempt to do a TLB flush on any CPU other than the
 * one on which the page is being mapped, even if the address space being
 * modified is currently loaded on another CPU.
 *
 * In effect, it is a force flag to ensure that an address space change is only
 * properly handled on ONE CPU. This is undesirable in most cases, and again,
 * you most likely do not need to use this flag.

 *
 * *NONE* of these flags can be 0x0. This is because the only way the pagefault
 * code can know that a page is not unmapped is if the page table entry is not
 * equal to 0.
