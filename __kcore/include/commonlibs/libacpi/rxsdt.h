	/**	EXPLANATION:
	 * These two functions are the garbage collection for the lib.
	 * (*) destroySdt():
	 *	This is used to unmap an ACPI table returned by any of the
	 *	functions getNextMadt(), getNextSrat(), getNextFacp() etc
	 *	defined above. Always use this when done cycling through the
	 *	RSDT, whether or not you let the lib return multiple instances
	 *	of the same table if a BIOS like that exists.
	 *
	 * (*) destroyContext():
	 *	While the lib is walking through the RSDT, it demand allocates
	 *	2 pages worth of loose vmem and maps them to the addresses of
	 *	tables in the RSDT. Of course, each physical address needs to be
	 *	mapped one by one, and the signature (FACP, SRAT, etc) needs to
	 *	be checked to see if it matches the type of table being looked
	 *	for by the caller.
	 *
	 *	The "context" argument is used to hold these two temporary,
	 *	loose pages which are demand mapped repeatedly to new tables for
	 *	signature checking. destroyContext() is called internally by the
	 *	lib at the end of a run through the RSDT.
	 *
	 *	This implies that you ran through the RSDT wholly, and you
	 *	were interested in processing multiple instances of a single
	 *	table type. For example, if an errant BIOS had generated 2 MADTs
	 *	this lib is able to process as many as there are. The
	 *	caller may however choose to only process the first one that
	 *	comes up. If you did NOT loop through the whole table, and only
	 *	processed the first one that was returned, then you must call
	 *	destroyContext() since the lib internals only call
	 *	destroyContext() if a full cycle-through was completed.
	 *
	 *	It should be called right after you call destroySdt().
