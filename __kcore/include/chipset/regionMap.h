/**	EXPLANATION:
 * chipsetMemRegionMapS is used to detail, at compile time, the special memory
 * ranges existent on the chipset. An example would be the IBM-PC, where there
 * is a 16MB region which most kernels reserve for DMA.
 *
 * Another example is a chipset with 32-bit PCI, which runs a 64-bit cpu. Or
 * even the x86-32 with the PAE enabled. In the latter's case, you'd need a
 * region which is under 4GB from which to allocate PDP tables.
 *
 * Technically this interface won't handle all of those completely gracefully,
 * but at any rate, *much* more cleanly than any other existing kernel to my
 * knowledge.
 *
 * The kernel will scan the entries presented here to determine how to
 * initialize memory regions for the chipset on which it is operating.
 *
 * If the pointer to the memory region map is NULL, then the kernel assumes
 * there are no memory regions.
