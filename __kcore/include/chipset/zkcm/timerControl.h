	/**	EXPLANATION:
	 * The Timer Control module, part of the Zambesii Kernel Chipset
	 * Module API aggregate, is the interface that the kernel calls on to
	 * manage timer sources on a chipset. The kernel will
	 * directly manage timer devices within ZKCM. There is no
	 * plan to allow UDI drivers for timers on a chipset.
	 *
	 * The Timer Control mod will present the kernel with a list of timer
	 * sources and, if the kernel ever becomes interested, timer devices,
	 * which can be filtered based on programming I/O latency, supported
	 * resolutions, and any other criteria necessary. A timer device may
	 * provide more than one timer source.

	 * queues it should spawn for the chipset it is running on. The
	 * chipset defines this bitmap value in its chipset specific code.
	 * Bit values are defined further up above as CHIPSET_TIMERS_*_SAFE.
	 *
	 * Not every chipset can operate stably with IRQs coming in every 1ms,
	 * for example. The chipset defines the bits which represent the timer
	 * periods which are /safe/ for models of that chipset. Generally though
	 * if a chipset model has a timer of a certain granularity, it was
	 * placed there by design, and the chipset was meant to process
	 * data that required timing at that frequency, so most chipsets will
	 * end up just defining all the frequencies supported by the timers on
	 * their model as safe.

	 * to ask the timer control module to return all timer sources that
	 * match the criteria passed as arguments. This allows the caller
	 * to query the chipset for available timer sources that specifically
	 * meet its needs.
	 *
	 * Should no such timer sources be available, the caller may do another
	 * search with less stringent constraints, until an acceptable timer
	 * is found, or the caller determines that it will be unable to operate
	 * reliably on this chipset.
	 *
	 * Searching is done by calling filterTimerSources() repeatedly,
	 * passing a NULL handle on the first call, and subsequently passing
	 * the same handle back until the function returns NULL.
