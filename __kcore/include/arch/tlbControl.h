/**	EXPLANATION:
 * Architecture specific, per-cpu TLB-state class. This class is useful only on
 * architectures which lack hardware assisted TLB loading. For an arch which
 * doesn't walk the page tables by itself, we have to emulate this service.
 *
 * The process is essentially started with a call to loadTranslation(). This
 * will return ERROR_SUCCESS on a successful lookup and load. Anything else
 * means that the process has accessed a page and the kernel does not know of
 * the mapping for that page, which means that something malignant has gone on
 * in userspace. The process must be terminated.
 *
 * For an arch without TLB loading, the idea is: CPU gets a linear address. CPU
 * looks in TLB for a translation. CPU has no translation for that vaddr in its
 * TLB. CPU triggers a page fault.
 *
 * The kernel must now walk the page tables by itself and load the right
 * translation from the page tables.
 *
 * This is contrasted severely with the fast page table walk that a hardware
 * assisted TLB model provides, where the CPU reads directly to physical RAM. We
 * have to slowly map each frame we need to read into vmem.
 *
 * To be perfectly fair, if writing to and reading from the TLB on an
 * architecture is very fast, then we can provide a very awesome optimization:
 * We could have a loadable TLB state for each process, which is saved on
 * process switch, and restored when a process is loaded onto a CPU. Which is
 * a very awesome optimization if you ask me.
