paddr_t is an integral type used to represent a physical address on the
relevant architecture.

On the x86-32, for example, with the PAE, we need a 64 bit type to represent a
physical address since the CPU supports a physical address space of > 2^32 in
PAE mode.

For an architecture without any sort of physical address space extension or
quirk, just define it to the architecture's word size.
