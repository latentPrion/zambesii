mathEmulation.h

This file must have a relevant .cpp file in the root/arch/ARCH_HERE/ dir,
on architectures which require runtime math emulation.

Any file which uses any form of mathematical calculations which require
emulation on any arch must include this file.

The file defines global operators to work on signed and unsigned integral types.
That is, in defining these operators globally, the compiler will insert a
a reference to the emulated sequence wherever needed such that mathematics
emultation is made implicit and transparent to the kernel source.

So: in a file with:
	x = x / y;

Which includes mathEmulation.h, where mathEmulation.h defines global operators
for division emulation, the compiler will auto-insert a reference to the
overloaded division sequence without us having to change the source.

C++ operator overloading ftw.
