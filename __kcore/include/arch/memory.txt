memory.h:

Must define the following macros for the architecture:

#define ARCH_MEMORY___KLOAD_VADDR_BASE		x
	This macro tells the kernel build where in the virtual address space of
	every process it resides. The kernel has been programmed to be able to
	stay within a fixed range of virtual memory in each address space and not
	cause any problems.

	You can even, for example, have a kernel build which takes up for example,
	the lower 1GB of a 4GB address space.
