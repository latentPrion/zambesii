**	Last branch recording facilities â€” Store branch records in the last branch
	record (LBR) stack MSRs for the most recent taken branches, interrupts, and/or
	exceptions in MSRs. A branch record consist of a branch-from and a branch-to
	instruction address. Send branch records out on the system bus as branch trace
	messages (BTMs).
	These facilities allow a debugger to be called as a separate task or as a procedure in
	the context of the current program or task. The following conditions can be used to
	invoke the debugger:

* Task switch to a specific task.
* Execution of the breakpoint instruction.
* Execution of any instruction.
* Execution of an instruction at a specified address.
* Read or write to a specified memory address/range.
* Write to a specified memory address/range.
* Input from a specified I/O address/range.
* Output to a specified I/O address/range.
* Attempt to change the contents of a debug register.

Debug registers DR4 and DR5 are reserved when debug extensions are enabled
(when the DE flag in control register CR4 is set) and attempts to reference the DR4
and DR5 registers cause invalid-opcode exceptions (#UD). When debug extensions
are not enabled (when the DE flag is clear), these registers are aliased to debug
registers DR6 and DR7.
