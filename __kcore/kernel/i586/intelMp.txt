Lapic Paddr base:
	0x00000000:FEC00000:	I/O APIC
	0x00000000:FEE00000:	LAPIC for the accessing logical CPU.

POSSIBLE SPECIFICATION IMPLIED MAX NUMBER OF CPUs ON CC-NUMA:
	May be implied by the I/O APIC's IRQ routing mechanism:

	The "Logical Destination Register" supports up to 32 bits, for
	addressing up to 32 APICs. This fact may imply that the Intel MP
	spec will allow only up to 32 SMP configured processors.

Section 3.5:
	"For systems based on the integrated APIC, posting of memory writes may
	result in spurious interrupts for memory-mapped I/O devices using
	level-triggered interrupts. I/O device drivers must serialize
	instructions to ensure that the device interrupt clear command reaches
	the device before the EOI command reaches the APIC and handles the
	spurious interrupt in case one occurs."

	That is, always issue a memory barrier instruction before using UDI GIO
	to send EOI.

CONTROLLING THE MODE OF THE APIC/PICs:
	IMCR_CTRL	port_space(0x22)
	IMCR_DATA	port_space(0x23)

	To access the IMCR_DATA reg:
		outb	$0x70, IMCR_CTRL
		// Now write as desired.

	To set the chipset into APIC mode, (Symmetric I/O mode):
		outb	$0x70, IMCR_CTRL
		// Writing 0x01 to IMCR turns on APIC mode.
		outb	$0x01, IMCR_DATA

		Setting the chipset into APIC mode implicitly also re-wires the
		PIC-INTR signals to the I/O APIC subsystem, and also wires the
		NMI there, too.

		At boot, the IMCR_DATA should have 0x00, which means that the
		PIC is circuited directly into the BSP, (as well as the NMI) so
		that the interrupt signals bypass the APIC and go into the BSP.

	NOTE: Section 3.6.2.1:
		"The IMCR must be cleared after a system-wide INIT or RESET to
		enable the PIC Mode as default. (Refer to Section 3.7 for
		information on the INIT and RESET signals.)"

		"The IMCR is optional if PIC Mode is not implemented. The IMCRP
		bit of the MP feature information bytes (refer to Chapter 4)
		enables the operating system to detect whether the IMCR is
		implemented."

		I have no idea what that means...

PROVISIONS FROM THE SPEC THAT IMPLY INIT/PARSING ORDER:
	* If the MP FP struct is supplied, then the spec's default base
	  addresses are to be taken from there, and not from the spec.

	  This means that the MP FP struct must be scanned for before trying
	  to interact with any AP CPU.

Section: 3.6.6:
	"The ID of each I/O APIC unit is set to zero during RESET. It is the
	responsibility of the operatingsystem to verify the uniqueness of the
	I/O APIC ID and to assign a unique ID if a conflict is found. The
	assignment of APIC IDs for I/O units must always begin from the lowest
	number that ispossible after the assignment of local APIC IDs. The
	operating system must not attempt to change the ID of an APIC I/O unit
	if the preset ID number is acceptable."

	This means that when checking I/O APIC IDs, one must ensure that one
	gives I/O APICs IDs that are contiguous to the last LAPIC ID.
