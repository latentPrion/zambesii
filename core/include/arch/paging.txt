paging.txt

All C/C++/HLL types in here must be protected by an __ASM__ guard so they aren't
included when compiling in ASM, etc.

Must define the following macros:

#define PAGING_NLEVELS		x
	This is the number of levels of tables the paging heirarchy has. So if the
	kernel is expected to navigate 2 levels of paging table structures before
	deriving a physical address translation for any virtual address, then this
	must be defined to 2.

#define PAGING_L0_NENTRIES	x
#define PAGING_L1_NENTRIES	x
#define ...
	The number of paging structure entries in each of the paging table levels.
	For example, on x86-32 without the PAE, (notice that the numbering
	begins at 0), we have two levels of paging structures, and level 0 has
	1024 entries, and level 1 also has 1024 entries.

	On x86-32 built with the PAE, there are 3 levels of paging structures, and
	level 0 has 4 entries, level 1 has 512, and level 2 also has 512.

#define PAGING_BASE_SIZE		x
	The base page size used for the architecture. An architecture may have any
	number of page sizes. The one used for the base size is the frame size that
	is handed out for physical memory allocations and also the size assumed to
	be the size of a paging structure table.

[#define PAGING_ALTERNATE_SIZE	x]
	The alternative paging size to be used for the architecture. This is only
	ever used in walkerPageRangerC <arch/walkerPageRanger.h>. When the kernel
	is mapping a virtual to physical address translation into the paging
	structures, it attempts to save memory by seeing whether or not it can use
	an alternate, larger paging size in order to reduce the number of frames
	needed to map out the virtual range to physical addresses.

	If you do not wish to use an alternate size, or the alternate size is
	dpeendent upon other factors, (like on x86-32, where 4MB pages are only
	supported if PSE is also supported), then leave this undefined.

#define PAGING_BASE_MASK_LOW
#define PAGING_BASE_MASK_HIGH
	The masks for the base paging size.

	for example, for a 4KB base page size, the low mask would be 0xFFF, and
	the high mask would be 0xFFFFF000.

[#define PAGING_ALTERNATE_MASK_LOW	x]
[#define PAGING_ALTERNATE_MASK_HIGH	x]
	The masks for the alternate size. Same logic as the base size. ONLY define
	these if the alternate size macro is defined.

#define PAGING_L0_VADDR_MASK
#define PAGING_L0_VADDR_SHIFT
#define PAGING_L1_VADDR_MASK
#define PAGING_L1_VADDR_SHIFT
...
	Define the shifts and masks to be used to extract the paging structure
	index for each level of the paging hierarchy.

	For example, on x86-32, there are 2 levels of paging structures, and to
	extract the page tables index for:

	Level0: We need to mask with 0xFFC00000, then shift right by 22.
	Level1: We need to mask with 0x003FF000, then shift right by 12.

	Thus the VADDR_MASK and VADDR_SHIFT are defined appropriately.

#define PAGING_L0_FLAG1
#define PAGING_L0_FLAG2
#define PAGING_L1_FLAG1
#define PAGING_L1_FLAG2
...
	These are the architecture specific flags for the page tables, and you may
	give them any name you please, as long as they are prefixed with PAGING_LX
	to define which level of the paging hierarchiy they pertain to.

Must define the following C/C++ types:

struct pagingLevel0S
{
	paddr_t		entries[PAGING_L0_NENTRIES];
} __attribute__(( aligned(ALIGNMENT) ));

	This is the level 0 paging structure entry format. It is generally going
	to be arch-specific. DO NOT use bitfields.

	From here, of course, define any number of other structs for each level
	of the paging hierarchy as needed.
