tlbState.h

Must define the following class, with the following API:

class tlbStateC
{
	public:
		void switchVaddrSpace(vaddrSpaceC *vaddrSpace)

		[void localFlushSpotless(void);]

		void localFlushVaddrSpace(void);
		void localFlushSingleEntry(void *vaddr);
		void localFlushEntryRange(void *vaddr, uarch_t nPages);

		void mpFlushSingleEntry(void *vaddr);
		void mpFlushEntryRange(void *vaddr, uarch_t nPages);

		[sarch_t fetchTranslation(void *vaddr);]
};

Any additional helper functinos, etc are perfectly okay and allowed, as usual
with class definitions. Inlines are allowed wherever senible.

tlbStateC::switchVaddrSpace(vaddrSpaceC *vaddrspace)
	Takes a vaddrspaceC * and uses that to load the TLB with entries from a new
	vaddrSpace. In time, this API may change toa llow the kernel to save TLB
	state per process on context switch so we avoid having to manually
	reload the TLB each time a vaddrSpace switch occurs.

	This function will automatically flush all TLB entries not associated with
	the current address space if the architecture has too few TLB entries.

	This problem may be alleviated by, as mentioned above, implementing per-
	process TLB state saves on swtiching address spaces. So when a vaddrspace
	is loaded, we restore its previous caching, and when it is switched away,
	we save its TLB state before the switch.

tlbStateC::localFlushSpotless(void)
	Flush all tlb cache entries on the local logical CPU. On an architecture
	with manual TLB management, this may be used to completely flush the TLB.

	If this is not used, then all 'global' translations will be preserved.

	Avoid using this function.

tlbStateC::localFlushVaddrSpace(void)
	Will flush all entries currently in the TLB associated with the current
	vaddrSpace. Pretty expensive, so avoid where possible. Most of the time,
	a simple localFlushsingleEntry() or localFlushEntryRange() should be more
	than adequate.

tlbStateC::localFlushSingleEntry(void *vaddr)
	Will flush the TLB entry associated with 'vaddr' out of the TLB on the
	current CPU. Used mostly after altering a virt-phys translation in the
	process's vaddrSpace.

tlbStateC::localFlushEntryRange(void *vaddr, uarch_t nPages)
	Will flush the range of entries from:
		vaddr to vaddr + (nPages * PAGING_BASE_SIZE) - 1
	from the local TLB.

sarch_t tlbStateC::fetchTranslation(void *vaddr)
	On an arch with hardware assisted TLB managament, this is not necessary.
	In fact, it may even be pre-processed or optimized out.

	This is the main function used to handle page-faults on all architectures.

	After the kernel finds out which address caused the fault, and rules out
	possibility of a permission error, or a reserved bit error, we now have
	to load the right translation for the address into the TLB.

	This function will magically return, and upon return, if the entry in the
	paging structures was loadable (present, etc), the function will return
	ERROR_SUCCESS. The kernel, upon receiving ERROR_SUCCESS from this method,
	can assume that the vaddr translation has been added to the TLB, and can
	return from the exception.

	If the return value is not equal to ERROR_SUCCESS, we can assume that the
	tranlsation in the page tables was not valid.

	This means that something was wrong. The error would NOT be a swapped out
	translation, though, since if the page table walk indicated that the page
	was on disk, this function would call the page swapper and re-obtain the
	physical data and place it on a frame and re-map the translation.

	In other words, this function will only return an error value if the
	translation cannot be fulfilled.
