Each driver API that the kernel specifies is made usable to driver developers
as a C++ class. A driver which exports that API should create a derived class
from the ZKCM API class and write the relevant methods.

From then on, that derived class can be instantiated in any of the instances
of that driver's device.

Example of a kernel API class:

// Defines a standard API package for all NIC drivers.
class zkcmNetworkDriverC
{
public:
	zkcmNetworkDriverC(zkcmDeviceC *device, void *self);

public:
	virtual sendFrame(int size, void *buff)=0;
	virtual receiveFrame(int size, void *buff)=0;
};

Example of a specific network driver:

// NE2000 driver, inherits from zkcmNetworkDriverC.
class ibmPcNe2000
:
public zkcmNetworkDriverC
{
public:
	ibmPcNe2000(zkcmDeviceC *device, void *self);

public:
	virtual sendFrame(int size, void *buff) { do_stuff(); }
	virtual receiveFrame(int size, void *buff) { do_other_stuff(); }

private:
	struct
	{
		ubit32 sendRegState, recvRegState;
	} regState;
}

In the above example class hierarchy, the kernel will always take the base class
as an argument, and will never care about the derived class attributes that
have been added on. C++ polymorphism will ensure that the correct method from
the class ibmPcNe2000 is called when the kernel does things like this:
	zkcmNetworkDriverC	*device;
	device->send(strlen("hello world!"), "hello world!");

---------------
class ne2000DeviceC
{
public:
	ne2000DeviceC(ubit32 childId)
	:
	ibmPcNe2000(&device),
	device(CC"ne2000", CC"Novell NE 2000 Compatible NIC",
		CC"Unknown Vendor", CC"Unknown vendor contact details")
	{}

public:
	ibmPcNe2000	net;
	zkcmDeviceC	device;
} ne2k0, ne2k1;
