v0.00.015 introduces significant improvements to locking mechanisms, build system modernization, and stability enhancements:

The next version increment should see completion of the UDI environment support and driver infrastructure, in preparation for finally bringing up a userspace.

The major bullet points for this version increment are:

Build System:
* Complete overhaul to use autoconf/automake for better cross-platform support
  * Rename core to __kcore because autotools assigns special meaning to files named "core" in the root directory
  * Improve include paths using abs_top_srcdir for better build consistency
  * Add proper support for building libzbzcrt_prebuild
  * Rename entry point to __korientationEntry for clarity
* Add scheduling-opts.m4 with preemption controls
  * --enable-sched-preemption: Enables preemption (passive or timeslice)
  * --enable-sched-preempt-kernel: Enables preemption in kernel
  * --with-sched-timeslice-us: Sets the timeslice scheduler duration
* Rename x8632 to i586 for architectural clarity
* Add CONFIG_MAX_NCPUS scaling option for better scalability
* Add conditional debug scheduler support

Locking and Synchronization:
* Significant overhaul of locking mechanisms
  * Implement atomic operations in assembly for i586
  * Use BTS/BTR for efficient flag manipulation
  * Move lock flags to upper bits of the lock integer
  * Use lower bits as a counter for read locks
* Add deadlock detection to RecursiveLock
  * Scale deadlock detection tries with active CPU count
  * Split sDeadlockBuffer into its own header for reuse
* Improve MultipleReaderLock algorithm
  * Eliminate race conditions in read/write transitions
  * Use CMPXCHG for better atomicity
* Enable IRQs briefly between lock spins for better responsiveness

CPU Management:
* Prevent CPU initialization from exceeding CONFIG_MAX_NCPUS
* Convert CpuTrib initialization macro to template for better type safety
* Don't panic on excessive cpuId unless it's the BSP
  * AP CPUs with cpuId >= MAX_NCPUs are simply ignored with a warning
  * BSP CPU with excessive ID still triggers panic due to power management concerns
* Re-enable IRQs and local interrupts on BSP CPU
* Improve CPU feature detection and power management

Floodplainn and UDI:
* ZUM: Rename message structures and implement Marshaling class
  * Better documented API and structures
  * Improved message handling between drivers
* Properly provide matching custom deleters for new() allocations
* Add locking to various floodplainn classes
  * fplainn::Device, DeviceInstance, DriverInstance, and Driver
  * Added proper locking to ParentTag::compiledConstraints
* Add support for child device enumeration in ZRootdev
  * Moved COPY_DEV_MEMBER_STRING_TO_ATTR macro to header for reuse
* Fix bug in UDI support to use UDI_ENUM_NEXT
  * Use enumeration attributes returned by enumerateAck
* Fix incorrect ParentID handling in CHANNEL_BOUND events

Memory Management:
* Fix critical bug in MemoryTrib with medium impact
  * Iterator for memory banks was incorrectly initialized to memoryBanks.end() instead of memoryBanks.begin()
  * This caused all memory banks to be skipped during initialization
  * Resulting in potential memory leaks and significantly reduced available memory
* Improve Bitmap allocation with better initialization
  * Added memzero for newly allocated memory when resizing
  * Added method to directly access bit capacity
* Fix SGList implementation
  * Remove redundant eAddressSize enum
  * Unify SGList format based on __PADDR_NBITS__
  * Fix signed comparison in ScatterGatherList::resize

Bug Fixes:
* Fix memory leak in FplainnStream::connect
  * Added missing deletion of blueprint object in error path
  * This was causing memory to leak when a channel initialization failed
* Fix mismatched operator delete calls causing memory corruption
  * Ensured proper pairing of allocation/deallocation methods
* Fix delete[] operator in ZKCMCore that used scalar delete instead of array delete
* Fix bug in VGA Terminal initialization
  * Replaced condition with assertion for better error detection
* Fix deadlock in InterruptTrib::retirePinIsr
  * Added busy-spin on sync flag for proper synchronization
* Fix errors in UDI driver initialization
  * Prevented malloc(0) when no instance attributes exist
  * Added separate warning when no control block is passed to enumerateChildren
* Fixed race condition in SingleWaiterQueue::addItem
  * Unblock() is no longer atomic with enqueue
  * Will now switch to newly unblocked thread if it's higher priority

Warnings and Code Cleanup:
* Fix numerous build warnings in Libx86emu
  * Added missing braces in sbb_word and sbb_long functions
  * Fixed pointer arithmetic warnings
* Fixed C++11 compatibility issues in test framework
  * Renamed macros from DEFVARS to DEFAULT_VARS for clarity
  * Added FAILED_DEFAULT_VARS0 for single parameter failures
* Fix initialization warnings in zrootdev and chipset code
  * Updated child_dev structure initialization to use field positions instead of designators
  * Added comments to maintain structure member ordering
* Fix signed/unsigned comparison warnings
  * Fixed sorting algorithm in memoryTrib_pmemInit.cpp
  * Added proper assertions for array bounds
* Fix memory handling in debugPipe
  * Added missing vprintf function
* Intense cleanup of orientation code
  * Removed dead test code and unused functions
  * Improved boot sequence flow
  * Eliminated unreachable code

Documentation and Other Improvements:
* Multiboot2 support with GRUB2 packaging files
* Improved debug output and diagnostics
  * Added task context dump for better debugging
  * Enhanced several dump() methods for better information
* Add __[US]ARCH_T_NBITS__ macros for better architecture abstraction

Concerns:
* UDI environment is functional but needs more testing
* Some concurrency issues may still exist in complex multi-CPU scenarios
* Scheduler improvements would benefit from additional real-world testing
